Challanges faced:
1. no fish
2. computational time
3. data set integration
4. hyperparamter tuning
5. Overfitting
6. similar looking species

Challanges we will face:
1. Source of information.
2. Source of data and how data integration was done
3. Data pre-processing
4. Why transfer learning
5. How did you test them
6. Co-ordination
7. What characterestics
8. Properly check which species are workinsg
